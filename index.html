        <p>To know what Puente MAS is we must first know what is our foundation, our brick and mortar, which is
            <a href="https://www.contracosta.edu/classes/learning-communities/puente-project/" target="_blank"> The Puente Project</a>.
            The Puente Project is a transfer preparation program in collaboration with the University of California
            designed to increase the number of educationally underserved students who transfer to four-year colleges
            and universities, earn degrees, and return to their communities as mentors. The program is offered as a
            partnership between the University of California and California Community Colleges. Now the difference
            between both programs is that Puente Mas is only offered at Contra Costa College at the moment, and it
            offers a more catered experience to students majoring in STEM, with those enrolled in orignal only needing
            to take ENGL 1AX, ENGL 2B, COUNS 103A, and COUNS 103B. While with PUENTE MAS on the other hand students are
            required to take MATH 171, MATH 171S which is a support class for MATH 171, ENGL 1AX, COUNS 103A, after that
            if a student decides to stay in the program for a second semester they would have to take MATH 190, COUNS 103B,
            and ENGL 1C totaling to a total of 24 credits which is a third of the required amount of credits to transfer
            a 4 year university.
