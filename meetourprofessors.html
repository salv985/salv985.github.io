            Welcome to Puente MAS!!! My name is Professor Marshall and I am excited to be a part of your college journey. I, like many of you, am a first-generation college student and I too started my journey at a Community College, while working 60 hours a week on the graveyard shift at an agricultural processing plant. I didn’t go to a 4-year college out of high school because I honestly hated school. I hated pointless classes and out of touch teachers who seemed more intent on wielding control over me than on seeing me develop into a scholar. I hated homework and rules and most importantly, I hated the fact that I wasn’t allowed to be creative. Well, things are different now. Now, I’m the teacher. This semester, we’ll use a highly collaborative environment, steeped in positivity, to grow our skills as readers, writers, and thinkers. In this student-centered environment, you will have the freedom to explore social justice topics that affect us all, that impact our lives and our communities. You will learn powerful tools and techniques that will enable you to become an agent of social change. And, most importantly, you will have the opportunity to develop your voice, your unique writing style.
